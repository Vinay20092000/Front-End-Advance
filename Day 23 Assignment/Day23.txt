Q1 What is axois package - npm?  Why do we use it in React?\
__ Axios is a Javascript library used to make HTTP requests and it supports the Promise API that is native to JS ES6.
Axios allows us to communicate with APIs easily in our React apps. Though this can also be achieved by other methods like fetch or AJAX, Axios can provide a little more functionality that goes a long way with applications that use React.  
Axios is a promise-based library used with Node.js and your browser to make asynchronous JavaScript HTTP requests.
