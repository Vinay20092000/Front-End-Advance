Q1 What are pipes in Angular??
__ Pipes in Angular are used to transform the data before displaying to view. Angular has some built-In pipes like  lowercase, uppercase, date, percent, currency, etc.And to achieve this transformation we use the pipe operator ( | ).
Ex:-
<p>Uppercase - {{name | uppercase}}</p>  
<p>Lowercase - {{name | lowercase}}</p>
<p>Currency - {{salary | currency:'INR'}}</p>  
<p>Date - {{birthday | date:'dd/MM/yyyy'}}</p>  

Q2 What is Gitbash?
__ Git Bash is a Microsoft Windows application with a Git command-line shell experience and utilities, such as Secure Shell Protocol (SSH), Secure Copy Protocol (SCP), CAT (concatenate command), etc. Bash is an acronym for Bourne Again Shell, which is a GNU Project shell.
A shell is used to interface with an operating system by executing commands, and Bash is the default shell used on Linux and macOS.

Q4 How to use DecimalPipe and PercentPipe in Angular?  Check with an example?
__ DecimalPipe
DecimalPipe is an angular Pipe API and belongs to CommonModule. DecimalPipe is used to format a number as decimal number according to locale rules. It uses number keyword with pipe operator. Find the syntax.
number_expression | number[:digitInfo]
Finally we get a decimal number as text. Find the description.
number_expression: An angular expression that will give output a number.
number : A pipe keyword that is used with pipe operator.
digitInfo : It defines number format.
Now we will understand how to use digitInfo. The syntax for digitInfo is as follows.
{minIntegerDigits}.{minFractionDigits}-{maxFractionDigits}
Find the description.
minIntegerDigits : Minimum number of integer digits. Default is 1.
minFractionDigits : Minimum number of fraction digits. Default is 0.
maxFractionDigits : Maximum number of fraction digits. Default is 3.

__ PercentPipe
Angular PercentPipe is an angular Pipe API that formats a number as a percentage according to locale rules. It belongs to CommonModule. Find the syntax.
number_expression | percent[:digitInfo]
Find the description.
number_expression: An angular expression that will give output a number.
percent : A pipe keyword that is used with pipe operator and it converts number into percent.
digitInfo: It defines a percentage format. We have described the use of digitInfo in DecimalPipe section. It is used with following syntax.
{minIntegerDigits}.{minFractionDigits}-{maxFractionDigits}
Default format:
minIntegerDigits = 1
minFractionDigits = 0
maxFractionDigits = 3
